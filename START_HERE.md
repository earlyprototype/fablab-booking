# 👋 START HERE - FabLab Equipment Booking System

## 🎯 What This Is

You're looking at a **standalone copy** of the FabLab Equipment Booking System, ready for deployment to Streamlit Cloud.

This folder has been copied **outside** the main v0.7 project folder, so it's completely safe to:
- ✅ Run `git init` here
- ✅ Create a new GitHub repository
- ✅ Deploy independently

**No risk to your main v0.7 project!** 🎉

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy? (5 Minutes)

### **Quick Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in THIS folder
pwd  # Check your current location

# 2. Initialize Git (safe - separate from v0.7)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: FabLab Equipment Booking System"

# 3. Create GitHub repo and push (choose one)

# Option A: GitHub CLI (fastest)
gh repo create fablab-booking --public --source=. --push

# Option B: Manual
# - Go to github.com/new
# - Create repo: fablab-booking
# - Then run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fablab-booking.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# 4. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
# - Go to share.streamlit.io
# - New app → Your repo → Main file: app.py
# - Deploy!
```

## 🆘 Quick Help

### **Local Testing:**
```bash
python start_booking_app.py
# Open: http://localhost:8503
```

### **Check Current Status:**
```bash
# See what files are here
ls -la

# Check if Git is initialized
git status
```

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **"Port 8503 in use"**: App is already running, just open browser
- **"Git not initialized"**: Run `git init` first
- **"Can't push"**: Make sure GitHub repo is created first

## 📧 Email Configuration (Optional)

Email notifications work via Microsoft Graph API. If you want booking confirmations:

1. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud first
2. Go to app Settings → Secrets
3. Add Microsoft Graph credentials (see HANDOVER.md for details)

**Note**: The app works fine without email - bookings still save!

---

## 🎯 Next Step

**Read this**: `QUICK_START.md` for step-by-step deployment

**Or jump straight in**:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create fablab-booking --public --source=. --push
```

Then deploy on [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)

---

## 🎉 That's It!

This standalone folder is ready for deployment. No dependencies on the v0.7 project. Safe to Git and deploy!

**Good luck! 🚀**
